# asl-alphabet-recognition
This project is a deep learning-based system designed to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets from static hand gestures. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), it classifies 26 letters of the ASL alphabet with high accuracy.

The goal is to improve communication accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing by converting hand gestures into alphabetical characters. The system is trained on an image dataset of ASL gestures, and includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
